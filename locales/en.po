"💵 To record a transaction, just write me a message specifying the sum, where you spent it (or where you got it from!) and how you paid for it (cash? card?)\n\n"
"**Just like this:**\n"
"```-5 food card\n"
"+25 gift cash\n"
"-15 fuel another_card\n"
"```\n\n"
"💬 If its the first time you mention a wallet, like `another_card`, the bot will prompt you for currency and create it for further use; same for the income/spend categories!"
